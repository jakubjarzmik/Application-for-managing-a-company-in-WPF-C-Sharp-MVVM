# Application-for-managing-a-company-in-WPF-C-Sharp-MVVM
Desktop application utilizing MVVM architecture, communicating with MS SQL database using Entity Framework, with features such as managing products, invoices, sales reports, etc.

The work on the application is still ongoing. The most important features that are still missing and will be added to the project in the near future are:
- Login
- Improve inheritance

The code will also be more organized. This is an application through which I am learning a lot and I am aware that the code in some places is not the best and properly organized, but I am also constantly learning to write clean code outside of work and project, so I will also definitely improve my spaghetti code in some places.

How to run the application?
1. To run the application, you need to have Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio installed.
2. The database files are located in the Database.zip folder and should be installed in one of the two possible ways mentioned in the "how to import the database.txt" file.
3. In Management Studio, check the name of your server.
4. In Visual Studio, find the file named App.Config in the project.
5. Using the combination of the CTRL+F keys, search for the name of the database server, which is "JJERZUPC", and replace it with the name of your server that you found earlier.
6. You can run the project now.
